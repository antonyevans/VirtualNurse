This app includes premium medical content developed by Harvard Medical School which helps you answer the question: "Do I need to see a doctor?".  <br>
<br>
The content is broken down into guides which cover 98% of medical concerns people have.  Each guide will ask you a series of questions to establish if things are normal, if you should see the doctor of if it's an emergency situation.<br>
<br>
There are three ways to find the correct guide:<br>
1. Press the microphone button, at the bottom of the screen, and describe your symptoms<br>
2. Press the keyboard button, bottom right of the screen, and input your symptoms by text<br>
3. Search the guides by touching the orange buttons<br>
<br>
Once you have selected a guide the Virtual Nurse will ask you a series of questions. You have two options for how to provide your response:<br>
1. The simplest option is just to press the orange button corresponding to your answer<br>
2. Alternatively you can press the microphone button and say your answer<br>
<br>
You can mute the speech at any time by pressing the audio icon in the top menu bar.<br>
